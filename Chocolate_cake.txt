Easy chocolate fudge cake

ingredients:

Sunflower oil
25 tsp

Self-raising flour
29 tsp

Cocoa powder
2 tbsp

Bicarbonate of soda
1 tsp

Caster sugar
25 tsp

Golden syrup
2 tbsp

egg
1 cup

milk
25tsp


Instructions:

1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.

2
Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.

3
Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.

4
To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.

5
Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.
