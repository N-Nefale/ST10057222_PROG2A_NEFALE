# ST10057222_PROG2A_NEFALE
This the work of Nefale Nefale ST10057222 for module Prog6221

To make use of my program you needed to create 2 c# classes Recipe and RecipeBook.
Then you run the program using the RecipeBook class(main method).
From there you follow the text displayed on the console.

Changes made:
1. Shortened the length of the scale method
2. Added more color to the applications
3. Allowed user to be able to select fro mutiple recipes in the view method
4. Made use of delagates to notify the user if calories are over 300
